# GEMINI.md - Your Guide to the AI-value Knowledge Management System

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the `AI-value` project, a personal knowledge management system. Use this as a guide for interacting with the files and structure.

## Directory Overview

This directory is a knowledge base built on the **PARA methodology** and designed for use with the **Obsidian** note-taking application. It is enhanced with an AI assistant called **"Claude Code"** to help manage and organize information.

The core structure is organized into four main categories based on actionability:

*   **`1 Projects/`**: For active projects with specific goals and deadlines.
*   **`2 Areas/`**: For long-term areas of responsibility without fixed deadlines.
*   **`3 Resources/`**: For topics of ongoing interest and reference materials.
*   **`4 Archives/`**: For completed or inactive items from the other categories.

Additionally, the system incorporates the **Zettelkasten** method for creating a network of atomic, interconnected notes, which are stored in the `5 Zettels/` directory.

New, unsorted notes and ideas are captured in the `0 Inbox/` directory before being organized into the PARA structure.

## Key Files & Directories

*   **`README.md`**: The primary source of truth for the project, explaining the methodology, structure, and workflows. It is available in English, Simplified Chinese (`README_zh-CN.md`), and Traditional Chinese (`README_zh-TW.md`).
*   **`0 Inbox/`**: The starting point for all new information. Regularly process notes from this directory.
*   **`1 Projects/`, `2 Areas/`, `3 Resources/`, `4 Archives/`**: The core folders of the PARA system.
*   **`5 Zettels/`**: Contains the Zettelkasten note system, divided into `fleeting`, `permanent`, and `literature` notes.
*   **`_templates/`**: A library of templates for creating new notes with a consistent structure.
*   **`.claude/`**: Configuration and command files for the "Claude Code" AI assistant.
*   **`.obsidian/`**: Configuration files for the Obsidian application, defining workspace settings and plugins.

## Usage and Workflows

This knowledge base is intended to be used within Obsidian. The primary workflow is as follows:

1.  **Capture**: Quickly add new thoughts, notes, and information into the `0 Inbox/` directory. The goal is to capture ideas without worrying about initial organization.
# 整理
3.  **Review**: Regularly review the contents of your `Projects` and `Areas` to stay on top of your tasks and responsibilities. The `/para-库概览` command can provide a status overview.
4.  **Archive**: Once a project is complete or an area/resource is no longer active, move it to the `4 Archives/` folder to keep your active workspace clean.

For knowledge development, use the Zettelkasten workflow to create atomic, linked notes, fostering a deeper network of ideas.
